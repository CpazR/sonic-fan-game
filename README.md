Hi! Thanks for checking out my project. It's definitely still WIP but I'm really happy with how it's turning out. Keep checking back for updates.

# What?
This project is a port of Sonic Advance 2 for the Game Boy Advance to Java. If you haven't played it yet, you should.

# Why?
SEGA isn't very good about porting their old games to newer hardware. Sonic Advance 2 was only ever release on the Game Boy Advance, and it has never been officially ported since then. This is truly tragic, because it's one of the best 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games. Because of this, the only ways to play it are to buy a Game Boy Advance (or a DS) and the game second-hand, or play it on an emulator. While this isn't inherently bad, the Game Boy Advance clearly had some shortcomings. For one, the original screen was awful. It also had a 240x160 screen resolution, so the fast-paced nature of Sonic games is somewhat difficult to keep up when you can't see what's coming.

I was also inspired by Alexander Brunetto, who is giving Sonic Advance the same treatment in the form of <a href="https://sonicadvancerevamped.tumblr.com/">Sonic Advance Revamped</a>. While I don't know if I can do Sonic Advance 2 as much justice as Alexander is giving Sonic Advance, I still want to try.

# How?
This project is being programmed in Java using LWJGL (OpenGL for Java, basically).
